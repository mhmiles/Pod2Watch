## Pod2Watch

Pod2Watch is a podcast player for the Apple Watch, available on the app store [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pod2watch-watch-podcast-player/id1223275627?mt=8). It reads podcasts out of the built-in media library so it can share files with the Apple Podcasts app on the iPhone. It also has the capability to download podcasts directly on the Apple Watch. I'm open sourcing this in hope that someone can find the code useful. I'm not very interested in further developing this with the current state of audio playback APIs on WatchOS [(see here)](https://marco.org/2017/09/24/what-watch-podcast-apps-need). Really hoping official Apple Podcasts support comes with WatchOS 5 but if you're looking for a really good Apple Watch podcast player until then check out [Outcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/outcast-for-watch/id1326693810?mt=8).
